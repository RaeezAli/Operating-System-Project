# Jarvis Operating System Simulator

A comprehensive Python-based AI assistant and Operating System simulation tool.

## 🚀 Overview

Jarvis is a multi-functional system that combines:

1.  **AI Assistant**: Voice-controlled commands for productivity, web searching, and casual conversation.
2.  **OS Simulator**: Implementation and visualization of core Operating System concepts like CPU scheduling, memory management, and deadlock prevention.

## 🛠️ Project Structure

- `src/core`: The brain of the assistant.
- `src/os_simulator`: Logic for OS simulations (Process Scheduling, Paging, etc.).
- `src/automation`: Tools for interacting with the file system, web, and external apps.
- `src/voice`: Speech-to-text and text-to-speech engines.
- `src/apis`: Integration with WolframAlpha and Wikipedia.
